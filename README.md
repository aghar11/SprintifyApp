# Sprintify App
This is an app that aims to help people stay on track for the objectives that they wish to achieve. The app will present a simple UI with a handful of timeframe boards where users can set their objectives for the associated time frames (eg. daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).

## Overarching Goal
Provide people with a simple app that they can check in with once a day for a short period of time, ~5-10 mins, and be able to easily keep track of their personal objectives. 

## Use Cases
### Use Case 1
At the beginning of every time-block, the user will be able to set their targets for the upcoming period of time and reflect on the completion of the previous objectives. For example, at the beginning of every day a user will have the opportunity to set objectives for the upcoming day, as well as reflect on the objective completion from the past day.

### Use Case 2
Provide users with a history of their objective completion. The history should be simple and visual enough to gain an understanding of a user's progress and consistency over the long term, but should also be able to be view more specific information if the user wants. For example, a user can see a long term view similair to the Apple Fitness calender but can also select specific days and see a more in depth summary.
